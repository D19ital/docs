ZMK is a modern keyboard firmware built with wireless-first ergonomics in mind.  
With ZMK, you can finely tune layers, modifiers, macros, hold/tap behaviors, and key logic to match your workflow, gaming habits, or specific apps. It also shines on low-power hardware, delivering responsive typing while keeping battery life in focus.
