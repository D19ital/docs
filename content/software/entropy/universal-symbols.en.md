Universal Symbols let you assign punctuation that produces the same character in English and Russian operating-system layouts

A regular key sends the same HID code regardless of language, so its result depends on the active layout, while a Universal action selects the correct combination inside compatible RMK firmware

{{< callout type="important" >}}
Universal Symbols are available only on Vial-RMK devices whose firmware advertises this capability to Entropy
{{< /callout >}}

Once assigned, Universal Symbols work autonomously in firmware and do not require Entropy to stay open

Entropy is used for configuration and automatic operating-system layout synchronization

## Available symbols

The **Universal** picker tab contains 32 ASCII punctuation characters:

```text
. , ; : ! ? / ` ~ ' " ( ) [ ] { } < >
- + * = # @ $ % ^ & | \ _
```

{{< video autoplay="true" loop="true" muted="true" src="/video/entropy/universal-picker-en.mp4" >}}

Compatible firmware also exposes the Russian letters `х`, `б`, `ю`, and `ъ` under **Special → International**, hold Shift for an uppercase letter

Unicode typography, arrows, mathematical signs, and extra currency symbols are not supported in this version

## Assignment

1. Connect a compatible RMK device
2. Open the required layer
3. Click a key on the layout
4. Open the **Universal** tab
5. Select a punctuation character or control action

Entropy displays these assignments with a two-line `Universal` legend and the selected character or action name

## Control actions

| Action | Behavior | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Toggle` | Toggles the English/Russian layout and firmware state | Primary manual language-switch key |
| `Sync` | Toggles only the firmware's internal layout state without changing the OS layout | When the OS and firmware states no longer match |
| `EN` | Explicitly switches the layout and firmware state to English | Dedicated switch-to-English key |
| `RU` | Explicitly switches the layout and firmware state to Russian | Dedicated switch-to-Russian key |
| `macOS` | Toggles Russian-layout mappings between PC and macOS | Correct punctuation on macOS |

`Toggle`, `EN`, and `RU` support autonomous use without Entropy

`Sync` does not send a system language switch, so it corrects firmware state without changing the layout already selected in the operating system

The `macOS` action changes the mapping table in firmware: leave PC mode enabled on Windows/Linux and use macOS mode on Apple computers

{{< video autoplay="true" loop="true" muted="true" src="/video/entropy/universal-controls.mp4" >}}

Layout Indicator highlights the active key, while the system language indicator makes the result of `Toggle`, `EN`, and `RU` visible

## Layout Sync

Layout Sync reports the current operating-system layout to firmware and automatically corrects its internal state after a system language switch

1. Open **Config → Live Features**
2. Find **Layout Sync**
3. Make sure the row displays **ready**
4. Enable the switch
5. Allow Entropy to keep running in the background

{{< layout-lightbox src="/images/entropy/layout-sync.png" alt="Layout Sync ready" width="900" >}}

{{< video autoplay="true" loop="true" muted="true" src="/video/entropy/layout-sync-en.mp4" >}}

With Layout Sync enabled, you can change language through the operating system and Entropy keeps firmware state synchronized

| System | Data source |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | Foreground-window layout |
| KDE Plasma | Active layout over D-Bus on Wayland or X11 |
| GNOME | Active layout over IBus D-Bus on Wayland or X11 |
| Other Linux X11 environments | Active XKB group |
| macOS | Current input source |

Other Linux Wayland environments may display **needs setup**, in which case use the firmware control actions or a supported KDE/GNOME/X11 session

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Universal Symbols use IBus only as a source of GNOME layout state, while the characters themselves are produced by firmware. The separate Entropy IBus backend is installed only for Text Expander
{{< /callout >}}

## Choosing a workflow

### Entropy always runs in the background

Enable Layout Sync and switch language through the operating system as usual

Keep `Sync` on an accessible layer as a manual recovery action

### Entropy does not run in the background

Assign `Toggle` or dedicated `EN` and `RU` actions so firmware can manage the language autonomously

If the language was changed by another method and punctuation becomes incorrect, press `Sync` once and test the output

## Testing

1. Open a text editor
2. Select the English layout
3. Press an assigned Universal Symbol
4. Switch to the Russian layout
5. Press the same key

The same character should appear both times

If the character differs, check Layout Sync, press `Sync`, and verify the PC/macOS mode

## If the tab is missing

- Update the device's RMK firmware to a version with Universal Symbols
- Reconnect the device
- Open **Layout → About device → Refresh device data** if firmware was updated without changing its name
- Make sure the device is connected through Vial-RMK rather than firmware without this capability
