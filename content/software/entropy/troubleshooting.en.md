## Entropy does not start

{{< tabs items="Windows,macOS,Linux" >}}
  {{< tab >}}

- Make sure you downloaded `windows-x86_64.exe`
- In SmartScreen, click **More info → Run anyway**
- Move the file from a temporary folder to a permanent location and run it again
- Check whether antivirus software blocked the file

  {{< /tab >}}

- Make sure you selected the correct architecture: `arm64` for Apple Silicon or `x86_64` for Intel
- Drag the application from the DMG to `/Applications`
- Run:

  ```bash
  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Entropy.app
  open /Applications/Entropy.app
  ```

  {{< /tab >}}
  {{< tab >}}

- Allow the AppImage to run with `chmod +x <file>.AppImage`
- Run it from a local filesystem rather than directly from an archive or network folder
- If no window appears, run the AppImage from Terminal and save the error output

## Device not found

1. Check the USB cable or device charge
2. Reconnect the device and wait for another scan
3. Open **Layout** and select the device manually
4. Close other configurators that may be holding the HID interface
5. Test another USB port

For Bluetooth, pair the device in operating-system settings first and then select its Bluetooth connection in Entropy

If both USB and Bluetooth entries exist for the same device, select the transport currently in use

### Linux

Open **Config → App settings → Vial access**, click **Install rules**, and reconnect the device

Do not run Entropy as root for normal use

### macOS Bluetooth

Allow Entropy under **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Input Monitoring**, fully quit the application, and launch it again

## Device locked

Some Vial devices prevent configuration changes until they are unlocked

1. Open **Config**
2. Click **Unlock device**
3. Hold the physical keys highlighted on the layout
4. Wait for the successful unlock message

You can lock the device again through the same menu after configuration

## Device data takes too long to load

Over Bluetooth, Entropy loads the first layer immediately and reads other layers and settings in the background

- Do not switch devices during initial loading
- Click **Retry** if only one section failed
- Reconnect the device after repeated failures
- Open **Layout → About device → Refresh device data** after a firmware update

Refreshing device data removes the local schema cache and reads it again

## A menu item is missing

Entropy hides features that the firmware does not expose

- Check the firmware version
- Connect the device and wait for all data to load
- Refresh device data after flashing new firmware
- Confirm that the required capability is supported by this firmware

Missing RGB, Auto Shift, Combos, modules, Universal Symbols, or another page is expected when firmware does not advertise that feature

## Changes are not saved

- Unlock the Vial device
- Wait for **Saved** before disconnecting
- Avoid starting several long operations at once over Bluetooth
- After a **Write failed** status, reconnect the device and try again
- Create a backup before importing a large layout again

## `.entlayout` import error

- Make sure the selected file is `.entlayout`, not an unrelated JSON file
- Do not edit the `format` and `version` fields manually
- Connect the target device before starting import
- Use exact mapping for the same model and universal mapping for another compatible geometry
- Review **Skipped** and **Firmware issues** in the report

Entropy creates an automatic backup of the current layout before applying the import

## Text Expander does not trigger

### General checks

- Enable **Text Expander**
- Keep Entropy running in the background
- Make sure the trigger starts with `:` or `;` and contains no spaces
- Confirm that the active application is not blacklisted
- Test with a simple single-line replacement

### Windows

Restart Entropy and test the rule in Notepad

### macOS

Grant Accessibility and Input Monitoring, then click **Restart event capture** in Backend setup

### Linux

Install IBus, add an **Entropy Text Expander** input source, and select it before typing the trigger

## A Universal Symbol produces the wrong character

1. Confirm that the key uses an action from **Universal** rather than a regular symbol
2. Open **Config → Live Features** and check Layout Sync
3. Press `Sync` once
4. Check `macOS` mode: off on Windows/Linux and on for macOS
5. Repeat the test in English and Russian layouts

See [Universal Symbols](../universal-symbols) for details

## Collecting diagnostics

1. Open **Config → App settings**
2. Enable **Diagnostics**
3. Reproduce the issue
4. Disable diagnostics after testing

When asking for help, include:

- Entropy version from **About Entropy**
- Operating system and desktop environment
- Device model and firmware version from **About device**
- Connection type: USB or Bluetooth
- Steps leading to the issue
- Error message and diagnostics log

Remove usernames, local paths, and other private data from logs before sharing them
